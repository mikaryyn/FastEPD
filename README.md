FastEPD
=======
A complete solution for driving parallel eink displays (think Kindle)<br>
Written by Larry Bank<br>

<b>Why did you write it?</b><br>
I'm fascinated by displays of all types, especially eink. I already wrote a library for SPI type displays (built-in controllers) called bb_epaper. Recent client projects involving parallel eink displays have inspired me to take a look at what it takes to drive them. At the time of this writing, most ESP32 projects which use parallel eink displays will make use of the EPDiy library. This library has been in existence for about 5 years and has grown to support a wide range of devices. For my use cases, the library is missing features and is complicated to modify, so I decided to re-invent the wheel.<br>

<b>What's special about FastEPD?</b><br>
Since writing several display libraries (OneBitDisplay, bb_spi_lcd, bb_epaper), I've used all of my experience with graphics and C++ APIs to create a clean design from the start. Libraries often grow in random ways over time as new features are bolted on and design problems are covered up with hacks. In this case, FastEPD has a better design from the begining and will be easier to maintain and understand. Some of the unique features are compressed fonts and graphics, more flexibility in display updates and a simple API which includes pre-configured setups for popular hardware.

<b> What devices are currently supported?</b><br>
At the moment, FastEPD supports the EPDiy V7 PCB, M5Stack PaperS3, LilyGo T5 S3 4.7 Pro, Inkplate 6PLUS and the Inkplate 5 gen 2. With the EPDiy V7 PCB, various 8 and 16-bit panels have been tested.<br>

<b>ESP-IDF note:</b><br>
The ESP-IDF builds use the newer I2C “driver_ng” master API (`driver/i2c_master.h`), which requires ESP-IDF v5.x.<br>
